Which of the following is the term generally used to refer to the act of deliberately accessing computer systems and networks without authorization?<p>A. Phishing</p><p>B. Threat</p><p>C. Vulnerability</p><p>D. Attack</p>;D. Attack is the term that is now generally accepted when referring to the act of gaining unauthorized access to computer systems and networks. The terms phishing, threat, vulnerability all relate to attacks, but are not the act of attacking.
Attacks by an individual or even a small group of attackers fall into which threat category?<p>A. Unorganized threat</p><p>B. APT</p><p>C. Singular threat</p><p>D. Hactivist</p>;D. Attacks by an individual or even a small group of attackers fall into the hactivist threat category. Attacks by criminal organizations usually fall into the structured threat category. The other two answers are not categories of threats used by the security community.
Which of the following is the term used to refer to individuals who do not have the technical expertise to develop scripts or discover new vulnerabilities in software but who have just enough understanding of computer systems to be able to download and run scripts that others have developed?<p>A. Script kiddies</p><p>B. Hackers</p><p>C. Simple intruders</p><p>D. Intermittent attackers</p>;A. Script kiddies is the label used to refer to individuals who do not have the technical expertise to develop scripts or discover new vulnerabilities in software but who have just enough understanding of computer systems to be able to download and run scripts that others have developed. Hackers is the more general term used to refer to individuals at all levels who attempt to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks. The other two answers are not terms used in the security community.
What is the name given to a group of hackers who work together for a collectivist effort, typically on behalf of some cause?<p>A. Script kiddies</p><p>B. Hacktivists</p><p>C. Motivated hackers</p><p>D. Organized intruders</p>;B. When hackers work together for a collectivist effort, typically on behalf of some cause, they are referred to as hacktivists. Hacktivist groups may include script kiddies, but in general script kiddies do not have the skills to participate in a meaningful manner in advancing a hacktivist cause, although they may be enlisted as ground troops to add volume to an attack. The other two terms are not generally used in the security community.
Attacks by individuals from organized crime are generally considered to fall into which threat category?<p>A. Highly structure threats</p><p>B. Unstructured threat</p><p>C. Structured threat</p><p>D. Advanced persistent threat</p>;C. Attacks by criminal organizations usually fall into the structured threat category characterized by a greater amount of planning, a longer period of time to conduct the activity, more financial backing to accomplish it, and possibly corruption of, or collusion with, insiders. Highly structured threats require greater planning, while unstructured threats require less, and APT attacks are typically nation state in origin, not organized criminals.
What is the name given to the group of individuals who not only have the ability to write scripts that exploit vulnerabilities but also are capable of discovering new vulnerabilities?<p>A. Elite hackers</p><p>B. Hacktivists</p><p>C. Uber hackers</p><p>D. Advanced persistent threat actors</p>;A. Elite hackers is the name given to those who not only have the ability to write scripts that exploit vulnerabilities but also are capable of discovering new vulnerabilities.
Criminal activity on the Internet can include which of the following? (Choose all that apply.)<p>A. Fraud</p><p>B. Extortion</p><p>C. Theft</p><p>D. Embezzlement</p><p>E. Forgery</p>;A, B, C, D, and E. Criminal activity on the Internet at its most basic is no different from criminal activity in the physical world. Fraud, extortion, theft, embezzlement, and forgery all take place in the electronic environment.
Warfare conducted against the information and information processing equipment used by an adversary is known as which of the following?<p>A. Information warfare</p><p>B. Cyber warfare</p><p>C. Offensive cyber operations</p><p>D. Computer espionage</p>;A. Information warfare is warfare conducted against the information and information processing equipment used by an adversary. Cyber warfare and offensive cyber operations are terms that you may encounter, but the more generally accepted term for this type of activity is information warfare. Computer espionage is generally associated with intelligence gathering and not general computer warfare.
What term is used to describe the type of threat that is characterized by a much longer period of preparation (years is not uncommon), tremendous financial backing, and a large and organized group of attackers?<p>A. Advanced capability threat</p><p>B. Structured threat</p><p>C. Nation-state threat</p><p>D. Highly structured threat</p>;D. A highly structured threat is characterized by a much longer period of preparation (years is not uncommon), tremendous financial backing, and a large and organized group of attackers. The threat may include attempts not only to subvert insiders but also to plant individuals inside of a potential target in advance of a planned attack. This type of threat generally is much more involved and extensive than a structured threat. The other terms are not commonly used in the security industry.
What is the term used to define attacks that are characterized by using toolkits to achieve a presence on a target network, with a focus on the long game—maintaining a persistence on the target network?<p>A. Covert network threat</p><p>B. Advanced persistent threat</p><p>C. Covert channel attack</p><p>D. Concealed network presence</p>;B. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are attacks characterized by using toolkits to achieve a presence on a target network and then, instead of just moving to steal information, focusing on the long game, maintaining a persistence on the target network. Their tactics, tools, and procedures are focused on maintaining administrative access to the target network and avoiding detection. Covert channels are indeed a concern in security but are a special category of attack. The other terms are not generally used in the security community.
Which of the following are reasons that the insider threat is considered so dangerous? (Choose all that apply.)<p>A. Insiders have the access and knowledge necessary to cause immediate damage to an organization.</p><p>B. Insiders may actually already have all the access they need to perpetrate criminal activity such as fraud.</p><p>C. Insiders generally do not have knowledge of the security systems in place, so system monitoring will allow for any inappropriate activity to be detected.</p><p>D. Attacks by insiders are often the result of employees who have become disgruntled with their organization and are looking for ways to disrupt operations.</p>;A, B, and D. Insiders frequently do have knowledge of the security systems in place and are thus better able to avoid detection.
When discussing threat concerns regarding competitors, which of the following is true?<p>A. There are no known cases of criminal activity involving people moving from competitor to competitor, taking insider information with them for years.</p><p>B. Where in the past it would take significant risk to copy the detailed engineering specifications of a major process for a firm, today it can be accomplished with a few clicks and a USB drive.</p><p>C. Modern search engines make it less likely that a competitor could steal intellectual property without being detected.</p><p>D. With increases in digital forensics, it is now more difficult to copy and steal proprietary digital information or disrupt operations.</p>;B. In today’s world of global economic activity, much of it is enabled by the interconnected nature of businesses. Many businesses have an information component that is easier to copy, steal, or disrupt than older, more physical assets. Additionally, there have been cases of people moving from competitor to competitor, taking insider information with them for years, even decades, before the Internet was developed.
Which of the following are true concerning attacker skill and sophistication? (Choose all that apply.)<p>A. The level of complexity for modern networks and operating systems has grown so that it is nearly impossible for anyone but the most skilled of hackers to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks.</p><p>B. Attackers do not have magic skills, but rather the persistence and skill to keep attacking weaknesses.</p><p>C. With the introduction of cloud computing during the last decade, attackers now primarily focus on the cloud, thus reducing the level of sophistication required to conduct attacks since they can focus on a more limited environment.</p><p>D. There is a surprising number of attacks being performed using old attacks, old vulnerabilities, and simple methods that take advantage of “low-hanging fruit.”</p>;B and D. While the complexity of systems is indeed increasing, there still exists a large number of computers and networks that have not been adequately protected, making it possible for less sophisticated attackers to gain unauthorized access. Additionally, while cloud computing has added another focus for attackers, it has not eliminated computer systems and networks in general as potential targets.
Which of the following is the term used to describe the processes used in the collection of information from public sources?<p>A. Media exploitation</p><p>B. Open source intelligence</p><p>C. Social media intelligence</p><p>D. Social engineering</p>;B. Open source intelligence is the term used to describe the processes used in the collection of intelligence from public sources. Human intelligence (HUMINT) is a specific category of intelligence gathering focused on obtaining information directly from individuals. The other terms are not generally used by security professionals.
What term is used to describe the gathering of information from a variety of sources, including non-public sources, to allow an entity to properly focus their defenses against the most likely threat actors?<p>A. Infosec analysis</p><p>B. Data intelligence</p><p>C. Threat intelligence</p><p>D. Information warfare</p>;C. Threat intelligence is the gathering of information from a variety of sources, including non-public sources, to allow an entity to properly focus their defenses against the most likely threat actors. Information warfare is conducted against the information and information processing equipment used by an adversary and consists of a larger range of activities. The other two terms are not generally used by security professionals.
You’ve been asked to perform an assessment of a new software application. Your client wants you to perform the assessment without providing you any information about how the software was developed or how data is processed by the application. This is an example of what type of testing?<p>A. White box testing</p><p>B. Passive testing</p><p>C. Black box testing</p><p>D. Active testing</p>;C. Black box testing is performed with no knowledge of the internal workings of the software being tested. The application is treated as a “black box”—the tester cannot see what’s inside the box.
While examining log files on a compromised Linux system, you notice an unprivileged user account was compromised, followed by several processes crashing and restarting, and finally the shadow file was accessed and modified. Which of the following techniques might the attacker have used?<p>A. Active scanning</p><p>B. Escalation of privilege</p><p>C. Passive scanning</p><p>D. Credentialed attack</p>;B. Escalation of privilege is the movement to an account that enables root-level activity. Typically, the attacker uses a normal user account to exploit a vulnerability on a process that is operating at root, enabling the attacker to assume the privileges of the exploited process—at root level. With root-level access, the attacker was able to access and modify the shadow file.
While running a vulnerability scanner against a Windows 2016 server, the tool reports the server may be affected by an offset2lib patch vulnerability. You find this odd because the offset2lib patch vulnerability only applies to Linux-based systems. Your vulnerability scanner has most likely reported which of the following?<p>A. System misconfiguration</p><p>B. Overflow finding</p><p>C. Actual negative</p><p>D. False positive</p>;D. A false positive is the erroneous reporting of an issue when none really exists. In this case the scanner incorrectly identified the presence of a Linux-specific vulnerability on a Windows system.
While responding to a security incident, your team examines network traffic logs. You see incoming connections to a web server in the DMZ. Several hours later in the same traffic logs you see connections from the web server to other systems in the DMZ as well as internal systems. This is an example of what type of technique?<p>A. Buffer overflow</p><p>B. SQL injection</p><p>C. Passive injection</p><p>D. Pivoting</p>;D. This is an example of pivoting. Pivoting occurs when an attacker gains access to a system and then uses that system to scan/attack other systems on the same network.
You’ve been asked to examine network traffic for evidence of compromise. You have 1TB of tcpdump logs to review. Which of the following tools would you use to examine these logs?<p>A. Nmap</p><p>B. Zenmap</p><p>C. Wireshark</p><p>D. Nessus</p>;C. Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer used for capturing and examining network traffic. Nmap and Zenmap are port scanners. Nessus is a vulnerability scanner.
A colleague calls you to ask for assistance. He is having trouble keeping an attacker out of his network. He tells you no matter what he tries, he can’t seem to keep the attacker out of his network and he has no idea how the attacker keeps getting in. This is an example of what kind of attack?<p>A. Gray box attack</p><p>B. Whack-a-mole attack</p><p>C. Advanced persistent threat</p><p>D. Privilege escalation</p>;C. This is most likely persistence efforts from an advanced persistent threat (APT). APTs typically try to avoid detection and employ methods that provide them with continued access to compromised systems.
Your network traffic logs show a large spike in traffic to your DNS server. Looking at the logs, you see a large number of TCP connection attempts from a single IP address. The destination port of the TCP connections seems to increment by one with each new connection attempt. This is most likely an example of what activity?<p>A. Active reconnaissance</p><p>B. Passive reconnaissance</p><p>C. Buffer overflow</p><p>D. Initial exploitation</p>;A. This is most likely an example of active reconnaissance. This particular traffic would be indicative of a TCP port scanning attempt where the attacker is probing the system for any open TCP ports.
You’ve been asked to examine a custom web application your company is developing. You will have access to design documents, data structure descriptions, data flow diagrams, and any other details about the application you think would be useful. This is an example of what type of testing?<p>A. Active testing</p><p>B. White box testing</p><p>C. Gray box testing</p><p>D. Active testing</p>;B. This is an example of white box testing. In white box testing, the tester has access to detailed knowledge of the things they are examining, whether it’s an application, host, or network.
You are attempting to perform an external vulnerability assessment for a client, but your source IP addresses keep getting blocked every time you attempt to run a vulnerability scan. The client confirms this is “as expected” behavior. You aren’t able to scan for vulnerabilities, but you have been able to do which of the following?<p>A. Identify vulnerability controls</p><p>B. Identify common misconfigurations</p><p>C. Passively test security controls</p><p>D. All of the above</p>;C. If your source IP addresses are blocked every time you attempt a vulnerability scan, you’ve successfully done a passive test of the client’s security controls. Your goal was to test for vulnerabilities, but the side effect of your testing validated the client’s security controls were working as intended.
What is the main difference between a credentialed and non-credentialed vulnerability scan?<p>A. A credentialed scan is performed by a certified professional.</p><p>B. A credentialed scan is performed with a valid userid/password.</p><p>C. A non-credentialed scan uses passive techniques.</p><p>D. A non-credentialed scan will identify more vulnerabilities.</p>;B. A credentialed scan is performed with a valid set of user credentials. Credentialed scans are performed with “valid user” access and have the potential to identify vulnerabilities inside an application or environment.
While validating a vulnerability, your colleague changes the password of the administrator account on the Windows Server she is examining (as proof of success). This is an example of what type of testing?<p>A. Intrusive testing</p><p>B. Credentialed testing</p><p>C. Passive testing</p><p>D. Security control testing</p>;A. This is an example of intrusive testing. Intrusive testing to validate a vulnerability involves exploiting the vulnerability and then making changes to the tested item to prove the vulnerability is present and exploitable. In this case, changing the administrator password proves your colleague could exploit the vulnerability she found.
A colleague shows you a scanning report indicating your web server is not vulnerable to the Heartbleed bug. You know this isn’t true as you’ve personally verified that web server is vulnerable. You believe the scanner used to examine your web server is reporting which of the following?<p>A. Common misconfiguration</p><p>B. False positive</p><p>C. False negative</p><p>D. SSL mismatch</p>;C. A false negative is when the scanner fails to report a vulnerability that actually does exist—the scanner simply missed the problem or didn’t report it as a problem.
Which of the following would be an example of initial exploitation?<p>A. Scanning a network using Nmap</p><p>B. Using a SQL injection attack to successfully bypass a login prompt</p><p>C. Using cracked credentials to delete customer data</p><p>D. Installing a backdoor to provide future access if needed</p>;B. Using a SQL injection attack to successfully bypass a login prompt is an example of initial exploitation. The vulnerability was identified and exploited, but no further action was taken. This proves the existence of the vulnerability and demonstrates the risk associated with the vulnerability.
Which of the following is a passive tool?<p>A. Tripwire</p><p>B. Nmap</p><p>C. Zenmap</p><p>D. Nessus</p>;A. Tripwire is the only passive tool listed. Tripwire detects changes to files based on hash values. Nmap and Zenmap are active tools that generate and send packets to systems being examined. Nessus is a vulnerability scanning tool.
What is the primary difference between penetration tests and vulnerability scans?<p>A. Penetration tests use active tools.</p><p>B. Vulnerability scans are performed from internal and external perspectives.</p><p>C. Penetration tests exploit discovered vulnerabilities.</p><p>D. Vulnerability scans never use credentials.</p>;C. Penetration testing is the examination of a system for vulnerabilities that can be exploited. The key is exploitation. There may be vulnerabilities in a system, in fact, one of the early steps in penetration testing is the examination for vulnerabilities, but the differentiation comes in the follow-on steps—the examination of the system in terms of exploitability. Discovered vulnerabilities are exploited during penetration testing.
You’re reviewing a custom web application and accidentally type a number in a text field. The application returns an error message containing variable names, filenames, and the full path of the application. This is an example of which of the following?<p>A. Resource exhaustion</p><p>B. Improper error handling</p><p>C. Generic error message</p><p>D. Common misconfiguration</p>;B. When an application fails to properly trap an error and generates error messages containing potentially sensitive information, this is known as improper error handling.
A web server in your organization has been defaced. The server is patched and properly configured as far as anyone can tell. Your logs show unusual traffic from external IP addresses just before the defacement occurred. It’s possible your server was attacked by which of the following?<p>A. Misconfiguration attack</p><p>B. Insider threat</p><p>C. Zero day exploit</p><p>D. Design weakness attack</p>;C. If a completely patched, properly configured server is successfully attacked, the most likely culprit is a zero day exploit. With zero day exploits, the vulnerability being exploited is unknown to the general public or the developer, so even a “fully patched” system is potentially vulnerable to zero day exploits.
You’re working with a group testing a new application. You’ve noticed that when three or more of you click Submit on a specific form at the same time, the application crashes every time. This is most likely an example of which of the following?<p>A. A race condition</p><p>B. A nondeterministic error</p><p>C. Undocumented feature</p><p>D. DLL injection</p>;A. This is most likely an example of a race condition. A race condition is an error condition that occurs when the output of a function is dependent on the sequence or timing of the inputs. In this case, the application crashes when multiple inputs are submitted at the same time because the application is not receiving the inputs or handling the inputs in the expected order.
Which of the following is a vulnerability related to a lack of vendor support?<p>A. The product has been declared “end-of-life” by the vendor.</p><p>B. The vendor is no longer in business.</p><p>C. The vendor does not support nonstandard configurations for its products.</p><p>D. All of the above.</p>;D. All of these are potential vulnerabilities associated with a lack of vendor support. When a vendor declares a product to be end-of-life, the vendor typically ends support for that product, which typically means it will provide no updates, patches, or maintenance even if critical vulnerabilities are later discovered. A vendor that no longer exists clearly can’t provide support or patches. Vendors that support only specific configurations may not provide maintenance, features, or patches that allow their product to work securely in your specific environment.
An externally facing web server in your organization keeps crashing. Looking at the server after a reboot, you notice CPU usage is pegged and memory usage is rapidly climbing. The traffic logs show a massive amount of incoming HTTP and HTTPS requests to the server. Which type of attack is this web server experiencing?<p>A. Input validation</p><p>B. Distributed error handling</p><p>C. Resource exhaustion</p><p>D. Race condition</p>;C. Resource exhaustion is the state where a system does not have all of the resources it needs to continue to function. In this case the server does not have the memory or CPU capacity to handle the massive volume of HTTP/HTTPS requests that are coming into the server.
A colleague on your team takes three times longer than you do to complete common tasks in a particular application. When you go to help him, you notice immediately that he doesn’t use any of the shortcuts designed into the application. When you ask him why he is not using shortcuts, he tells you he didn’t know the shortcuts exist. This is an example of which of the following?<p>A. An untrained user</p><p>B. Improper application configuration</p><p>C. Memory leak</p><p>D. Lack of vendor support</p>;A. Your colleague is an untrained user. Untrained users are users who do not know how to operate a system efficiently or securely because they haven’t received training associated with the system’s capabilities.
Your organization is considering using a new ticket identifier with your current help desk system. The new identifier would be a 16-digit integer created by combining the date, time, and operator ID. Unfortunately, when you’ve tried using the new identifier in the “ticket number” field on your current system, the application crashes every time. The old method of using a 5-digit integer works just fine. This is most likely an example of which of the following?<p>A. Common misconfiguration</p><p>B. Zero day vulnerability</p><p>C. Memory leak</p><p>D. Integer overflow</p>;D. An integer overflow is a programming error condition that occurs when a program attempts to store a numeric value, an integer, in a variable that is too small to hold it. In this case the 16-digit integer is too large for the field that’s working just fine with the 5-digit integer.
While examining a laptop infected with malware, you notice the malware loads on startup and also loads a file called netutilities.dll each time Microsoft Word is opened. This is an example of which of the following?<p>A. Zero day exploit</p><p>B. DLL injection</p><p>C. System infection</p><p>D. Memory overflow</p>;B. This is an example of DLL injection. DLL injection is the process of adding to a program at run time a DLL that has a specific vulnerability of function that can be capitalized upon by an attacker.
You’re providing incident response services for a small company after a breach. The first thing you notice is the entire network is completely flat once you get behind the firewall. Services, user workstations, and printers are all on the same subnet with no VLANs or network segmentation. This is an example of what type of weakness?<p>A. Architecture/design weakness</p><p>B. Network traversal weakness</p><p>C. TCP overflow weakness</p><p>D. Memory leak weakness</p>;A. A flat network designed with no network segmentation increases the likelihood an attacker can easily traverse the network and gain access to sensitive information. The problem lies with the how the network was designed/built. This is known as an architecture/design weakness.
A web application you are reviewing has an input field for username and indicates the username should be between 6 and 12 characters. You’ve discovered that if you input a username 150 characters or more in length, the application crashes. What is this is an example of?<p>A. Memory leak</p><p>B. Buffer overflow</p><p>C. Directory traversal</p><p>D. Integer overflow</p>;B. This is a fairly classic example of a buffer overflow. The input routine does not validate the provided input to ensure a maximum of 12 characters are received and processed. In this case, the application tries to store all 150 or more characters of the username, resulting in areas of memory being overwritten and causing the application to crash.
You’ve been asked to help address some findings from a recent PCI (Payment Card Industry) audit, one of which is support for SSL 2.0 on a web server. Your CFO wants to know why SSL 2.0 support is a problem. You tell her SSL 2.0 support is an example of which of the following vulnerabilities?<p>A. Separation of duties</p><p>B. Default configuration</p><p>C. Resource exhaustion</p><p>D. Weak cipher suites</p>;D. SSL 2.0 is an example of a weak cipher suite. While technically the protocol used for SSL 2.0 is not a “vulnerability,” the cipher suites used in SSL 2.0 are cryptographically insecure—meaning an attacker can “break them” and access the content you are trying to protect.
Your organization is having issues with a custom web application. The application seems to run fine for a while but starts to lock up or crash after 7 to 10 days of continuous use. Examining the server, you notice that memory usage seems to climb every day until the server runs out of memory. The application is most likely suffering from which of the following?<p>A. Memory leak</p><p>B. Overflow leak</p><p>C. Zero day exploit</p><p>D. Pointer dereference</p>;A. Memory leaks are programming errors caused when a computer program does not properly handle memory resources. Over time, while a program runs, if it does not clean memory resources as they are no longer needed, it can grow in size, with chunks of dead memory being scattered across the program’s footprint in memory. If a program executes for a long time, these can grow and consume resources, causing a system to crash.
While examining internal network traffic, you notice a large amount of suspicious traffic coming from an IP address in the development environment. The IP address isn’t listed on any network diagram and shouldn’t be active on your network as far as you can tell. When you ask the developers about it, one of them tells you he set up that server over 12 months ago for a temporary project and forgot all about it. This is an example of which of the following?<p>A. Single server contingency</p><p>B. DLL injection</p><p>C. Undocumented asset</p><p>D. Insider threat</p>;C. This is a good example of an undocumented asset. The server was added to the environment, but the appropriate network documentation was never updated.
While auditing an organization, you discover that new users are added to the domain by sending an e-mail request to the IT department, but the e-mails don’t always come from Human Resources, and IT doesn’t always check with HR to ensure the new user request corresponds to an authorized user. This is an example of which of the following?<p>A. Process overflow</p><p>B. Vulnerable business process</p><p>C. Insider threat</p><p>D. Trojan e-mail attack</p>;B. This is an example of a vulnerable business process. If IT is creating new user accounts based on e-mails it receives without validating that the requests are valid, then an attacker could take advantage of this process.
Which of the following is an example of an embedded system?<p>A. A user workstation</p><p>B. A web server</p><p>C. A network-enabled thermostat</p><p>D. A database server</p>;C. The network-enabled thermostat is an example of an embedded system. This device is a stand-alone, single-purpose system that is a component of a larger system (the HVAC system in this case).
An attacker has decided to attempt to compromise your organization’s network. They have already determined the ISP you are using and know your public IP addresses. They have also performed port scanning to discover your open ports. What communications technique can the hacker now use to identify the applications that are running on each open port facing the Internet?<p>A. Credentialed penetration test</p><p>B. Intrusive vulnerability scan</p><p>C. Banner grabbing</p><p>D. Port scanning</p>;C. Banner grabbing is the communications technique a hacker can use to identify the product that is running on an open port facing the Internet.
You are the security manager for a large organization. Your NIDS has reported abnormal levels of network activity and several systems have become unresponsive. While investigating the causes of these issues, you discover a rootkit on your mission-critical database server. What is the best step to take to return this system to production?<p>A. Reconstitute the system.</p><p>B. Run an antivirus tool.</p><p>C. Install a HIDS.</p><p>D. Apply vendor patches.</p>;A. The only real option to return a system to a secure state after a rootkit is reconstitution.
If user awareness is overlooked, what attack is more likely to succeed?<p>A. Man-in-the-middle</p><p>B. Reverse hash matching</p><p>C. Physical intrusion</p><p>D. Social engineering</p>;D. Social engineering is more likely to occur if users aren’t properly trained to detect and prevent it. The lack of user awareness training won’t have as much impact on man-in-the-middle, reverse hash-matching, or physical intrusion attacks.
A pirated movie-sharing service is discovered operating on company equipment. Administrators do not know who planted the service or who the users are. What technique could be used to attempt to trace the identity of the users?<p>A. Typo squatting</p><p>B. Integer overflow</p><p>C. Watering hole attack</p><p>D. Ransomware</p>;C. A watering hole attack could be used to plant phone-home-to-identity malware on the systems of subsequent visitors.
You are the IT security manager for a retail merchant organization that is just going online with an e-commerce website. You hired several programmers to craft the code that is the backbone of your new web sales system. However, you are concerned that while the new code functions well, it might not be secure. You begin to review the code, systems design, and services architecture to track down issues and concerns. Which of the following do you hope to find in order to prevent or protect against XSS?<p>A. Input validation</p><p>B. Defensive coding</p><p>C. Allowing script input</p><p>D. Escaping metacharacters</p>;A, B, and D. A programmer can implement the most effective way to prevent XSS by validating input, coding defensively, escaping metacharacters, and rejecting all script-like input.
What type of virus attempts to disable security features that are focused on preventing malware infection?<p>A. Retrovirus</p><p>B. Polymorphic</p><p>C. Companion</p><p>D. Armored</p>;A. Retroviruses specifically target antivirus systems to render them useless.
What does the acronym RAT stand for?<p>A. Random Access Token</p><p>B. Remote Authentication Testing</p><p>C. Random Authorization Trajectory</p><p>D. Remote Access Trojan</p>;D. A RAT is a remote access Trojan. A RAT is a form of malicious code that grants an attacker some level of remote control access to a compromised system.
What form of social engineering attack focuses on stealing credentials or identity information from any potential target?<p>A. Phishing</p><p>B. Tailgating</p><p>C. Dumpster diving</p><p>D. Logic bomb</p>;A. Phishing is a form of social engineering attack focused on stealing credentials or identity information from any potential target. It is based on the concept of fishing for information. Phishing is employed by attackers to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, or other personally identifiable information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity (a bank, a service provider, or a merchant, for example) in electronic communication (usually email).
What type of service attack positions the attacker in the communication path between a client and a server?<p>A. Session hijacking</p><p>B. Man-in-the-middle</p><p>C. Amplification</p><p>D. Replay</p>;B. A man-in-the-middle attack is a communications eavesdropping attack. Attackers position themselves in the communication stream between a client and server (or any two communicating entities). The client and server believe that they’re communicating directly with each other—they may even have secured or encrypted communication links.
What form of attack abuses a program’s lack of length limitation on the data it receives before storing the input in memory and can lead to arbitrary code execution?<p>A. ARP poisoning</p><p>B. XSS</p><p>C. Domain hijacking</p><p>D. Buffer overflow</p>;D. A buffer overflow attack occurs when an attacker submits data to a process that is larger than the input variable is able to contain. Unless the program is properly coded to handle excess input, the extra data is dropped into the system’s execution stack and may execute as a fully privileged operation.
What is a programmatic activity that restricts or reorganizes software code without changing its externally perceived behavior or produced results?<p>A. Buffer overflow</p><p>B. Pass the hash</p><p>C. Refactoring</p><p>D. Shimming</p>;C. Refactoring is restricting or reorganizing software code without changing its externally perceived behavior or produced results. Refactoring focuses on improving software’s nonfunctional elements (quality attributes, nonbehavioral requirements, service requirements, or constraints). Refactoring can improve readability, reduce complexity, ease troubleshooting, and simplify future expansion and extension efforts.
What wireless attack is able to trick mobile device users into connecting into its man-in-the-middle style of attack by automatically appearing as if it is a trusted network that they have connected to in the past?<p>A. Replay</p><p>B. Evil twin</p><p>C. Bluesnarfing</p><p>D. Disassociation</p>;B. Evil twin is an attack where a hacker operates a false access point that will automatically clone or twin the identity of an access point based on a client device’s request to connect. Each time a device successfully connects to a wireless network, it retains a wireless profile in its history.
What type of hacker hacks for a cause or purpose, knowing that they may be identified, apprehended, and prosecuted?<p>A. Hacktivist</p><p>B. Script kiddie</p><p>C. Nation-state hacker</p><p>D. Internal attacker</p>;A. A hacktivist is someone who uses their hacking skills for a cause or purpose. A hacktivist commits criminal activities for the furtherance of their cause. A hacktivist attacks targets even when they know they will be identified, apprehended, and prosecuted. They do this because they believe their purpose or cause is more important than themselves.
When an attacker selects a target, they must perform reconnaissance to learn as much as possible about the systems and their configuration before launching attacks. What is the term for the gathering of information from any publicly available resource, such as websites, social networks, discussion forums, file services, and public databases?<p>A. Banner grabbing</p><p>B. Port scanning</p><p>C. Open-source intelligence</p><p>D. Enumeration</p>;C. Open source intelligence is the gathering of information from any publicly available resource. This includes websites, social networks, discussion forums, file services, public databases, and other online sources. This also includes non-Internet sources, such as libraries and periodicals.
What penetration testing or hacking term refers to the concept of continuing an intrusion after an initial compromise in order to further breach an organization by focusing on new targets that may not have been accessible initially?<p>A. Man-in-the-browser</p><p>B. Pivot</p><p>C. Daisy chaining</p><p>D. Shimming</p>;B. In penetration testing (or hacking in general), a pivot is the action or ability to compromise a system, then using the privileges or accessed gained through the attack to focus attention on another target that may not have been visible or exploitable initially. It is the ability to adjust the focus or the target of an intrusion after an initial foothold is gained.
What is the term for an attack or exploit that grants the attacker greater privileges, permissions, or access than what may have been achieved by the initial exploitation?<p>A. Hoax</p><p>B. Impersonation</p><p>C. Piggybacking</p><p>D. Privilege escalation</p>;D. Privilege escalation is an attack or exploit that grants the attacker greater privileges, permissions, or access than may have been achieved by the initial exploitation.
What type of information-gathering tactics rely on direct interaction with the target while attempting to avoid being detected as malicious?<p>A. Passive reconnaissance</p><p>B. Banner grabbing</p><p>C. Active reconnaissance</p><p>D. Social engineering</p>;C. Active reconnaissance is the idea of collecting information about a target through interactive means. By directly interacting with a target, the attacker can collect accurate and detailed information quickly but at the expense of potentially being identified as an attacker rather than just an innocent, benign, random visitor.
What type of test of security controls is performed with an automated vulnerability scanner that seeks to identify weaknesses while listening in on network communications?<p>A. Active</p><p>B. Passive</p><p>C. External</p><p>D. Noncredentialed</p>;B. A passive test of security controls is being performed when an automated vulnerability scanner is being used that seeks to identify weaknesses while listening in on network communications.
What is the term used to describe systems that are no longer receiving updates and support from their vendors?<p>A. Passive</p><p>B. Embedded</p><p>C. End-of-life</p><p>D. Static</p>;C. End-of-life systems are those that are no longer receiving updates and support from their vendor. If an organization continues to use an end-of-life system, the risk of compromise is high because any future exploitation will never be patched or fixed. It is of utmost important to move off end-of-life systems in order to maintain a secure environment.
What is present on a system for ease of installation and initial configuration in order to minimize support calls from new customers?<p>A. Default configuration</p><p>B. Resource exhaustion trigger</p><p>C. Buffer overflow flaw</p><p>D. Collision tool</p>;A. Default configurations should never be allowed to remain on a device or within an application. Defaults are such for ease of installation and initial configuration in order to minimize support calls from new customers.
Which of the following describes the difference between a worm and a virus?<p>A. Viruses are self-replicating.</p><p>B. Viruses are often malicious.</p><p>C. Worms are self-replicating.</p><p>D. Viruses are often malicious.</p>;C. Worms are self-replicating. Answer A is incorrect because viruses require an infected file to be executed or launched to replicate. Answers B and D are incorrect because both viruses and worms are usually malicious.
Which one of the following is not an example of a denial-of-service attack?<p>A. Fraggle</p><p>B. Smurf</p><p>C. Gargomel</p><p>D. Teardrop</p>;C. A Gargomel attack sounds cool, but it does not actually exist. Fraggle, Smurf, and Teardrop are names of specific denial-of-service attacks. Therefore, answers A, B, and D are incorrect.
Which one of the following is not a type of phishing attack?<p>A. Spear phishing</p><p>B. Wishing</p><p>C. Whaling</p><p>D. Smishing</p>;B. Wishing is not a type of phishing attack. Answers A, C, and D are incorrect because these all do describe a type of phishing attack. Spear phishing is targeted. Whaling is spear phishing that specifically targets high-profile personnel. Smishing is SMS-based phishing.
At your place of employment, you are rushing to the door with your arms full of bags. As you approach, the woman before you scans her badge to gain entrance while holding the door for you, but not without asking to see your badge. What did she just prevent?<p>A. Phishing</p><p>B. Whaling</p><p>C. Tailgating</p><p>D. Door diving</p>;C. Tailgating involves closely following someone with authorized physical access to gain access to the environment. Answers A and B are incorrect because these describe methods of acquiring sensitive information by masquerading as a trustworthy source. Answer D is also incorrect.
Which of the following is an effective way to get information in crowded places such as airports, conventions, or supermarkets?<p>A. Vishing</p><p>B. Shoulder surfing</p><p>C. Reverse social engineering</p><p>D. Phishing</p>;B. Shoulder surfing uses direct observation techniques. It gets its name from the tactic of looking over someone’s shoulder to obtain information. Answer A is incorrect because vishing uses a phone to obtain information. Answer C is incorrect because reverse social engineering involves an attacker convincing the user that he or she is a legitimate IT authority, causing the user to solicit assistance. Answer D is incorrect because phishing is an attempt to acquire sensitive information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity via an electronic communication, usually an email.
Which one of the following is designed to execute malicious actions when a certain event occurs or a specific time period elapses?<p>A. Logic bomb</p><p>B. Spyware</p><p>C. Botnet</p><p>D. DDoS</p>;A. Logic bombs are designed to execute after certain events, on a certain date, or after a specific time period. Answers B, C, and D are incorrect. Spyware, Botnets, and DDoS are all threats, but they do not execute malicious code after a specific event or period.
Which one of the following best describes a polymorphic virus?<p>A. A virus that infects EXE files</p><p>B. A virus that attacks the boot sector and then attacks the system files</p><p>C. A virus inserted into a Microsoft Office document such as Word or Excel</p><p>D. A virus that changes its form each time it is executed</p>;D. Polymorphic viruses can change their form each time they are run. Answers A, B, and C describe different types of viruses, such as program, multipartite, and macro, respectively, so those answers are incorrect.
You discover you are unable to access files on your computer. A message appears asking for payment to allow for the recovery of your files. Which of the following is most likely?<p>A. Your files have been deleted.</p><p>B. Your files have been moved to a remote server.</p><p>C. Your files have been encrypted.</p><p>D. Your files have been copied.</p>;C. This situation implies ransomware or crypto-malware. In this attack, files are encrypted and are essentially “held ransom” until payment is made. Answer A is incorrect because the attacker wants to ensure that you have the ability to access your files, which will further encourage others who are infected to also pay. Often, however, the attacker deletes or threatens to delete files if the ransom isn’t paid after a defined period of time. Answers B and D are incorrect because the files are encrypted only on the target system.
Which of the following types of attacks can result from the length of variables not being properly checked in the code of a program?<p>A. Buffer overflow</p><p>B. Replay</p><p>C. Spoofing</p><p>D. Denial of service</p>;A. Buffer overflows result from programming flaws that allow too much data to be sent. When the program does not know what to do with all this data, it crashes, leaving the machine in a state of vulnerability. Answer B is incorrect because a replay attack records and replays previously sent valid messages. Answer C is incorrect because spoofing involves modifying the source address of traffic or the source of information. Answer D is incorrect because the purpose of a DoS attack is to deny the use of resources or services to legitimate users.
Which one of the following is a best practice to prevent code injection attacks?<p>A. Session cookies</p><p>B. Input validation</p><p>C. Implementing the latest security patches</p><p>D. Using unbound variables</p>;B. Input validation is the one of the most important countermeasures to prevent code injection attacks. Answer A is incorrect because session cookies pertain to maintaining state within a visit to a website. Answer C is incorrect because, although ensuring that systems are patched is a good practice, it is not specifically a best practice to prevent code injection attacks. Answer D is incorrect because proper input validation to prevent code injection relies on bound variables.
You are the security administrator for a bank. The users are complaining about the network being slow. It is not a particularly busy time of the day, however. You capture network packets and discover that hundreds of ICMP packets have been sent to the host. What type of attack is likely being executed against your network?<p>A. Spoofing</p><p>B. Man-in-the-middle attack</p><p>C. Password attack</p><p>D. Denial-of-service attack</p>;D. A ping flood is a DoS attack that attempts to block service or reduce activity on a host by sending ping requests directly to the victim using ICMP. Spoofing involves modifying the source address of traffic or source of information. A man-in-the-middle attack is commonly used to gather information in transit between two hosts. A password attack attempts to gain unauthorized access by going after the authentication control for an account. Answers A, B, and C are incorrect.
An initialization vector should be which of the following?<p>A. Unique and unpredictable</p><p>B. Unique and predictable</p><p>C. Repeatable and random</p><p>D. Repeatable and unique</p>;A. An initialization vector (IV) should be unique and unpredictable. Answers B, C, and D do not apply to IV and are incorrect.
How do relationship and capability pertain to understanding specific threat actors?<p>A. They indicate the likelihood of vulnerabilities being discovered.</p><p>B. They are characteristics associated with building a threat profile.</p><p>C. They describe attributes that apply equally to all threats.</p><p>D. They are the two most important attributes when analyzing threat actors.</p>;B. Relationship and capability are characteristics that can be attributed to threat actors. Other common attributes include motive and intent, both of which are associated with building a threat profile. Answer A is incorrect because these do not pertain to the discovery of vulnerabilities. Answer C is incorrect because each attribute varies, based on specific threat actors. Answer D is incorrect because threat actors and overall risk are unique to each organization.
With which of the following is a “low and slow” attack most associated?<p>A. APT</p><p>B. Ransomware</p><p>C. OSINT</p><p>D. Script kiddies</p>;A. An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a “low and slow” style of attack executed to infiltrate a network and remain inside while going undetected. Answer B is incorrect because ransomware is obvious and sends a clear message to the end user in an attempt to extort compensation from the victim. Answer C is incorrect. OSINT describes Open Source Intelligence, which is the term given to information available for collection from publicly available sources. Answer D is incorrect because script kiddies, unlike APTs, are usually not sophisticated in their methods and are usually easily detected.
After conducting a vulnerability assessment, which of the following is the best action to perform?<p>A. Disable all vulnerable systems until mitigating controls can be implemented</p><p>B. Contact the network team to shut down all identified open ports</p><p>C. Immediately conduct a penetration test against identified vulnerabilities</p><p>D. Organize and document the results based on severity</p>;D. After an assessment, the results should be organized based on the severity of risk to the organization. Answer A is incorrect because it is generally an extreme response, except in rare situations. Answer B is incorrect because many open ports are required for a network to function. Answer C is incorrect because, although a penetration test often does follow a vulnerability scan, it is not an immediate necessity and certainly is not required to be run against all identified vulnerabilities.
You are conducting a penetration test on a software application for a client. The client provides you with details around some of the source code and development process. What type of test will you likely be conducting?<p>A. Black box</p><p>B. Vulnerability</p><p>C. White box</p><p>D. Answers A and C</p>;C. White box testing is more transparent. Because you are provided with source code, you have more knowledge about the system before you begin your penetration testing. Answer A is incorrect because black box testing assumes no prior knowledge. Answer B is incorrect because this refers to a weakness. Therefore, answer D is also incorrect.
Which of the following is a reason to conduct a penetration test?<p>A. To passively test security controls</p><p>B. To identify the vulnerabilities</p><p>C. To test the adequacy of security measures put in place</p><p>D. To steal data for malicious purposes</p>;C. A penetration test helps quantify the adequacy of security measures put in place and helps organizations understand the potential impact of threats against the environment. Answers A and B are incorrect because these describe the purpose of a vulnerability scan. Answer D is also incorrect. A penetration test is a “friendly” attack to help safeguard an organization from a real attack. A penetration test should never be used for malicious purposes, even if it succeeds in deeply penetrating an organization.
Which one of the following best describes a penetration test?<p>A. A passive evaluation and analysis of operational weaknesses using tools and techniques that a malicious source might use</p><p>B. An evaluation mimicking real-world attacks to identify ways to circumvent security</p><p>C. The monitoring of network communications and examination of header and payload data</p><p>D. A technique used to identify hosts and their associated vulnerabilities</p>;B. A penetration test reveals security weaknesses through real-world attacks. The results can help prioritize risk and identify areas for improvement. Penetration tests are active evaluations, so answer A is incorrect. Answer C is incorrect because it describes network sniffing. Answer D is incorrect because it describes vulnerability scanning. However, both network sniffing and vulnerability scanning can be used as part of the penetration process.
Which one of the following best describes the four primary phases of a penetration test?<p>A. Planning, discovery, attack, reporting</p><p>B. Exploit, escalation, pivot, persistence</p><p>C. Planning, exploit, attack, persistence</p><p>D. Discovery, attack, pivot, reporting</p>;A. Planning, discovery, attack, and reporting are the four primary phases of a penetration attack. Answer B is incorrect because it describes the four key steps within the attack phase. Answers C and D are incorrect because they do not describe the proper four primary phases.
Your team is tasked with conducting a vulnerability assessment and reports back with a high number of false positives. Which of the following might you recommend to reduce the number of false positives?<p>A. Have the team run a vulnerability scan using noncredentialed access</p><p>B. Have the team run a vulnerability scan using credentialed access</p><p>C. Have the team run a port scan across all common ports</p><p>D. Have the team run a port scan across all ports</p>;B. Noncredentialed vulnerability scans result in a greater number of false positives. This type of scan provides an outsider point-of-view, and although it might indicate what an outsider is more likely to see, it does not as effectively show the full extent of vulnerabilities. A credentialed vulnerability scan provides access into systems that might otherwise not be accessible, to further determine legitimate vulnerabilities. As a result, answer A is incorrect. Answers C and D are incorrect because vulnerability scans initially do scan specified ports as part of the process.
Which of the following are potential impacts of a race condition?<p>A. System malfunction</p><p>B. Denial of service</p><p>C. Escalated privileges</p><p>D. All of the above</p>;D. System malfunction, denial of service, and escalated privileges are all potential impacts because of a race condition.
Which one of the following is the term given to a fraudulent wireless access point that is configured to lure connections to it?<p>A. Evil twin</p><p>B. ARP replay attack</p><p>C. Bluejacking</p><p>D. NFC</p>;A. An evil twin is a type of rogue access point that gets between a client and a legitimate wireless access point. The evil twin can then be used to attack the systems that connect to it. Answer B is incorrect: An ARP reply attack describes an attack against a wireless access point in an attempt to determine the key. Answer C is incorrect: Bluejacking refers to a Bluetooth wireless device sending messages to other Bluetooth-enabled devices. Answer D is incorrect because NFC refers to the communications protocol between devices within close proximity to each other.
A small IT consulting firm has installed new wireless routers across all your small regional offices. Within days, you learn that you are unable to access the administrative interfaces of these routers due to an incorrect password. Which one of the following is most likely the reason?<p>A. The wireless routers were set up with the default configuration, which included a default password that was never changed.</p><p>B. The wireless routers are not powered on.</p><p>C. The wireless routers have been placed on end-of-life by the manufacturer and are no longer supported for remote login.</p><p>D. The wireless routers have been designed to allow improper input handling, resulting in failed password input.</p>;A. In this scenario, the wireless routers most likely include a known default password that was never changed upon installation. This gave an outsider a simple means of access. Answer B is incorrect because, in that case, you would not be able to even attempt login. Answers C and D are also incorrect. Not being able to log in is not associated with end-of-life systems. Improper input handling refers to solutions that are not properly validating input to the system, this would more likely result in the capability to put arbitrary strings within the input fields to cause some type of undesirable behavior.
You identify a system that becomes progressively slower over a couple days until it is unresponsive. Which of the following is most likely the reason for this behavior?<p>A. Improper error handling</p><p>B. Race condition</p><p>C. Memory leak</p><p>D. Untrained user</p>;C. A memory leak is the most likely culprit. A memory leak occurs when an application or process continually consumes memory. Memory is usually finite, after it is consumed, the system becomes unresponsive. Answers A and B might ultimately lead to a memory leak, but these are not the best answer. Improper input handling will likely impact the data flow and expectations of the system. This can also potentially lead to a memory leak. A race condition can result in a variety of malfunctions, but this is not the best answer. Answer D is also incorrect because an untrained user is not likely the explicit reason for such a condition.
